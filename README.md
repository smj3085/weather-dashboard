# weather-dashboard

A weather dashboard app created using the Open Weather Map data API. 
When the user searches the name of a city in the search bar, then the app will display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. It will also provide an image representing the conditions. The UV index will change color depending on the severity (i.e.favorable, moderate, severe) of the index. 
Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that searched city is displayed below the current weather details and shows the temperature, humidity and wind speed for the next 5 days.
